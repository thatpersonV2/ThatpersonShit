            <p>[First Post] Hello everyone. This is my new blog ThatpersonShit. (10:43am 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[Survivng Anarchy] Today I am going to talk about my minecraft server Survivng Anarchy (Website can be found in the other section). It's an anarchy server therefore there are no rules. You can hack, dupe, and destroy all you want. It hasnt been getting much traffic and I would like to change that. Go check it out! (11:03am 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[Site Changes] I have made some major site changes including different pages. (11:36am 6/14/2020)</p>
