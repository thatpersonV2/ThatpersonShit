            <p>[First Post] Hello everyone. This is my new blog ThatpersonShit. (10:43am 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[Site Changes] I have made some major site changes including different pages. (11:36am 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[Spookbreaker] This is a youtube channel I helped create. Pretty funny. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCouTDq_H76HnODwkY8lPr6A (11:50am 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[PS5] Everyone has been making fun of the PlayStation 5 design calling it a “router” and shit. I think it looks nice. It’s a good redesign that looks modern and different. I also really like the controller design. It looks cool and fits with the console perfectly. (7:35pm 6/14/2020)</p>
            <p>[Kids and C++] std::cout << "Hello World!" is something kids send in Omegle or Discord chat to look cool. Usually a person writes back "What does that mean?"  and the kid says "It's a C++ script. Do you even know what programming is?"  thinking he is so cool because his mom bought him the "Make a game" programming book from the Barnes & Noble children's section. This is also usually annoying because they are acting like C++ is the only form of programming by saying "Do you even know what programming is?" In this age of easily accessible computers,  we will never be able to truly rid the world of children who thing that they have a PHD in Computer Science and Software Engineering because they know how to print a line of text.

            <p>[Bored] I'm super bored rn. I'm waiting for ARK: Survival Evolved to install. Have a nice day. (7:30pm 6/19/2020)</p>
